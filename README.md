# Page index generator

Have you ever read an instruction page, or GitHub read me that's sooooo long,
and there is no way to navigate between parts easily?

Maybe you'd like something like Wikipedia's table of contents,
which makes it easier to navigate. However, the table of contents is fixed.
When you want to see it again you'd have to scroll back to top.

Seeing such struggle, I've decided to write this script to help you navigate
more easily.

Disclaimer: This only works with pages whose sections are `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`,
and each of those must have ids.
